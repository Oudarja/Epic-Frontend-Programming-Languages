Q1)what does mean by manipulating dom in js?

Manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript refers to the process of interacting with and modifying the structure, content, and style of a web page using JavaScript.

The DOM is a programming interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a web document. It represents the structure of the web page as a tree-like hierarchy, where each element (such as a paragraph, image, or button) is considered a node in the tree.

By manipulating the DOM, you can perform various operations, such as:

1)Accessing and Selecting Elements: You can use JavaScript to select specific elements on the page, such as by their tag name, class, ID, or other attributes, using methods like document.getElementById(), document.querySelector(), and document.querySelectorAll().

2)Modifying Element Properties: Once you have selected an element, you can change its properties, such as the text content, attributes, or CSS styles, using properties like element.textContent, element.setAttribute(), and element.style.

3)Creating, Inserting, and Removing Elements: You can dynamically create new elements, insert them into the DOM, or remove existing elements using methods like document.createElement(), element.appendChild(), element.insertBefore(), and element.removeChild().

4)Handling Events: You can attach event listeners to DOM elements, allowing you to respond to user interactions, such as clicks, mouse movements, or key presses, using methods like element.addEventListener().

5)Traversing the DOM: You can navigate the DOM tree, moving from one element to another, using properties like element.parentNode, element.children, and element.nextSibling.

Manipulating the DOM is a fundamental part of web development using JavaScript, as it allows you to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It enables you to update the content and appearance of a web page without having to reload the entire page, improving the user experience and responsiveness of your web applications.


Q2)There are Bootstrap for CSS and Bootstrap for Javascript when should i use what?
-> The Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files serve different purposes, and you should use them based on the functionality you need in your web application:

1) Bootstrap CSS:

Use the Bootstrap CSS link tag to include the Bootstrap CSS framework in your HTML document.
The Bootstrap CSS provides a set of pre-designed styles and components that you can use to quickly build responsive and mobile-friendly web interfaces.
It includes styles for things like typography, buttons, forms, navigation, and more.
Including the Bootstrap CSS allows you to leverage the pre-built styles and components without having to write all the CSS from scratch.


2) Bootstrap JavaScript (Bootstrap Bundle):

Use the Bootstrap JavaScript script tag to include the Bootstrap JavaScript bundle in your HTML document.
The Bootstrap JavaScript bundle includes the core JavaScript functionality for various Bootstrap components, such as modals, dropdowns, tooltips, and more.
It also includes dependencies like Popper.js, which is used for positioning and layout of some components.
Including the Bootstrap JavaScript bundle allows you to use the interactive and dynamic components provided by Bootstrap in your web application.
In general, you should include both the Bootstrap CSS and the Bootstrap JavaScript bundle in your HTML document if you want to use the full functionality of the Bootstrap framework. The CSS provides the styling, and the JavaScript enables the interactive components.

However, if you only need the CSS styles and don't require the interactive components, you can include just the Bootstrap CSS link tag and omit the JavaScript bundle. Conversely, if you only need the interactive components and don't require the default Bootstrap styles, you can include just the JavaScript bundle and write your own custom CSS.

Q3)== and ===?
->The triple equal sign === is the strict equality operator.
It is used to check if two values are equal in both value and type.
Example: 5 === 5 evaluates to true, because both the value and the type are the same.
Example: 5 === '5' evaluates to false, because the values are the same but the types are different (number and string).
The == operator in JavaScript is the loose equality operator, and it works differently than the === strict equality operator.

The main difference between == and === is that == performs type coercion, while === does not.

Here's how the == operator works:

Type Coercion: If the two operands are not of the same type, JavaScript will attempt to convert one or both of the values to a common type before performing the comparison.

Comparison: Once the values are of the same type, the comparison is made based on their values.
As you can see, the == operator can sometimes lead to unexpected results due to the implicit type coercion. This is why it's generally recommended to use the === strict equality operator instead, which does not perform any type coercion and simply checks if the values and types are exactly the same.

***Coercion is the act or process of persuading someone forcefully to do something that they do not want to do.

Q4)Difference between Var and let?
-> The main differences between var and let in JavaScript are:

**Scope:
var has function scope or global scope, meaning the variable is accessible within the function it was defined in, or globally if defined outside of a function.
let has block scope, meaning the variable is accessible within the block (e.g., inside a pair of curly braces {}) it was defined in.

**Hoisting:
var variables are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with a value of undefined.
let variables are also hoisted, but they are not initialized. Accessing a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.

**Redeclaration:
var variables can be redeclared within the same scope without causing an error.
let variables cannot be redeclared within the same block scope, and will throw a SyntaxError.
